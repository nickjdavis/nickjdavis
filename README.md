- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr Nick Davis, or @nickjdavis
- 👀 I’m an experimental psychologist and a neuroscientist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. I am interested in non-invasive stimulation of the human brain, using technologies like TMS and tDCS.
- 🌱 Please don't get too excitied about the code in my repos. I am a competent but workmanlike coder, mainly in Matlab or Python. The code here is a collection of tools for getting some science done.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any aspects of tDCS/TMS, particularly in how we can improve the techniques for individual people with individual requirements.
- 📫 You can usually find me on Twitter: @n_j_davis
